Use array of characters to store game state
Choice menu system using case statements
Linked lists to store gamestates to allow undo/redo functions
When dealing with undo functions, make sure to delete old redo functions if new choice is made
Hash key linked to linked list id for recalling old games
Add delay between moves when replaying old games

Possible fixes - Read in as string and convert - check for undo/redo string.
Check for 0 input - redirect to new options
