Plan - Make Board - print lines to draw board with variables representing x, o, -
Use array of characters to store game state
Choice menu system using case statements
Linked lists to store gamestates to allow undo/redo functions
When dealing with undo functions, make sure to delete old redo functions if new choice is made
Hash key linked to linked list id for recalling old games
Add delay between moves when replaying old games

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible fixes - Read in as string and convert - check for undo/redo string.
Check for 0 input - redirect to new options
start all over

AI functions
have int array of valid inputs
Add random number generator
remove from valid input as int is selected
have ai select random from valid
place initial check for player 1-2
if player 1 - validate input and remove from array - turns out thats a pain to do, could recursion random til hit valid input?
